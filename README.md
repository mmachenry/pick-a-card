# pick-a-card
A simple web app to practice the timing on Twisted Fate's Pick a Card ability.

Twisted Fate is a champion from the game League of Legends. He is often
considered a complicated champion requiring the player to learn a bit more than
average to master. One primary focus is his Pick a Card spell, which requires
thre player to have good timing and hand-eye coordination to use effectively.
This app will allow you to practice the timing without having to load the game
or play. So if you want to practice for just a minute or two on your lunch break,
this app is for you.

You can find the app running over here on GitHub pages:
